  (A sample file is provided in the VECTO archive)
- All parameters are optional, if a parameter is not provided the default value
  (see table below) is used

| Parameter name            | Value | Explanations |
|:---------------           |:-----:|:-------------|
| `Rating_current_gear`     | 0.97  | Defines the minimum fuel efficiency advantage in a candidate gear to trigger a gear shift (i.e. 3% of a value of 0.97) - applies only for AMT transmissions|
| `Rating_current_gear_APT` | 0.97  | Defines the minimum fuel efficiency advantage in a candidate gear to trigger a gear shift (i.e. 3% of a value of 0.97) - applies only for APT transmissions |
| `RatioEarly(Up/Down)shiftFC`   | 24 | In gears with a higher total drivetrain ratio (axle plus gearbox) than this parameter, “Efficiency shifts” are disabled, i.e. the shifts are only triggered by the shift lines. Rationale: Gear shift in this gears are primarily triggered by pow er demand.
| `AllowedGearRangeFC`      | 2     | Defines the gear range for candidate gears for “Efficiency Shifts”(+/-) - applies only fot APT transmissions |
| `AllowedGearRangeFCAPT`   | 1     | Defines the gear range for candidate gears for “Efficiency Shifts”(+/-) - applies only fot APT transmissions with ≤ 6 gears Allowed |
| `GearRangeFCAPTSkipGear`  | 2     | Defines the gear range for candidate gears for “Efficiency Shifts”(+/-) - applies only fot APT transmissions with more than 6 gears |
| `AccelerationFactorNP98h` | 0.5   | Defines the reduction of driver target acceleration in the engine speed range betw een nT98h and nP98h |
| `ATLookAheadTime`         | 0.8   | Defines look ahead time for rating of fuel consumption for AT transmissions. |

### New input parameters

- The new input fields (see table below) are optional in this version. When this release candidate
  will be an official version manufacturers MAY certify their new vehicles using the new input
  parameters. As from 1 st July 2019 the new input fields will become mandatory. Further details are
  provided in the timetable on the next page.

- Default values when the new input parameters are not provided:

  **Input parameters vehicle - Table 1 Annex III**

  | Field               | Default value |
  |---------------------|---------------|
  | VehicleCategory     | No default value but input 'rigid truck' will be converted automatically into 'rigid lorry' |
  | ZeroEmissionVehicle | 'No' |
  | NgTankSystem        | 'Compressed' (only applicable to gas vehicles) |
  | SleeperCab          | 'Yes' |
  
  **Input parameters ADAS - Pt. 8 Annex III**

  | Field                     | Default value |
  |---------------------------|---------------|
  | EngineStartStop           | 'No' |
  | EcoRollWithoutEngineStop  | 'No' |
  | EcoRollWithEngineStop     | 'No' |
  | PredictiveCruiseControl   | 'No' |

  Currently **only** the fuel type `NG PI` for the **engine certification** is allowed by 2017/2400. For LNG
  vehicles, therefore, the engine fuel type has to be set to `NG PI` and at the vehicle level
  NgTankSystem has to be set to **liquefied**. For CNG the same engine fuel type is used but
  NgTankSystem has to be set to **compressed**.

### VTP Simulation Mode
- Verification Test Procedure (VTP) Simulation Mode
- Similar to Pwheel mode, different cycle format (see user manual)
- Requires:
  - Vehicle in declaration mode (XML)
  - Measured driving cycle
  - Parameters for engine-fan model
- VECTO calculates the gear based on the wheel speed and engine speed (and
  vehicle parameters) and ignores the gear provided in the driving cycle
- Fuel consumption interpolation is done using the engine speed from the cycle
  and calculated power demand (to avoid wrong engine speeds due to wrong gear
  selection)
- Simulation uses all auxiliaries except engine fan
  - Engine fan is modeled separately, power demand depends on fan speed (see user manual)
- Auxiliary power selected according to segment table, BUT power demand
  depends on vehicle speed
  - v < 50 km/h: Urban
  - 50 <= v < 70 km/h: Rural
  - v >70 km/h: Long haul
- Gear and fuel consumption in the driving cycle are optional for now, may be used
  in future versions

## Notes for using Vecto 3.x with AAUX
- The AdvancedAuxiliaries module requires the number of activations
  for pneumatic consumers (brakes, doors, kneeling) and the
  (estimated) total cycle time. This can be configured in the .APAC-file
  (actuations file). For standard bus/coach cycles (i.e., the cycle file
  contains “bus” and “heavy_urban” or “suburban” or “interurban” or
  “urban”; or the cycle contains “coach” (case insensitive)) the
  actuations file already contains the number of activations and the
  cycle time. For other cycles the filename without extension is used
  to lookup the activations in the .APAC file (case sensitive)
  
- Vecto 3 uses an average auxiliaries load (determined by the AAUX
  module depending on the settings) for the simulation. The AAUX module
  computes the fuel consumption in parallel to VectoCore and accounts for
  smart consumers (e.g., alternator, pneumatics, …).

- Output:
  - The .vmod file contains both, the fuel consumption calculated by VectoCore
    (per simulation interval) and AAUX (accumulated and per simulation interval).
  - Columns in .vmod file:
    - AA_TotalCycleFC_Grams [g]: accumulated fuel consumption as computed by the AAUX model,
      considering smart consumers
    - FC-Map [g/h]: fuel consumption as computed by VectoCore interpolating in the FC-Map,
      using an average base load of auxiliaries
    - FC-AUXc [g/h]: fuel consumption corrected due to engine stop/start
      (currently not applicable)
    - FC-WHTCc [g/h]: WHTC-corrected fuel consumption (not applicable in engineering mode)
    - FC-AAUX [g/h]: fuel consumption per simulation interval, derived from
      AA_TotalCycleFC_Grams
    - FC-Final [g/h]: final fuel consumption value with all (applicable) corrections applied
      (stop/start, WHTC, smart auxiliaries)
- Output .vsum
  - Columns in .vsum file:
    - FC-Map: total fuel consumption as computed by VectoCore interpolating in the FC-Map,
      using an average base load of auxiliaries
    - FC-AUXc: total fuel consumption corrected due to engine stop/start
      (currently not applicable)
    - FC-WHTCc: WHTC-corrected fuel consumption (not applicable in engineering mode)
    - FC-AAUX: fuel consumption per simulation interval, derived from AA_TotalCycleFC_Grams

  - v_air/beta cross-wind correction (vcdb)
- Adaptations of powertrain components architecture
  - Move wheels inertia from vehicle to wheels
  - Auxiliaries no longer connected via clutch to the engine but via a separate port
  - Engine checks overload of gearbox and engine overload
- Fixed some driving behavior related issues in VectoCore:
  - When the vehicle comes to a halt during gear shift, instead of aborting the cycle,
    it tries to drive away again with an appropriate gear.
- ModData Format changed for better information and clarity
- Added validation of input values (according to latest VectoInputParameters.xls)
- Various bugfixes

### Pwheel (SiCo) Mode

- Function as already available in Vecto 2.2 also added in Vecto 3.0.2
  - Driving cycle specifies power at wheel, engine speed, gear, and
    auxiliary power
  - No driver model in the simulation.
  - The Vecto gear-shift model is overruled.
  - Function used for creating reference results for SiCo tests
  - For details see user manual: Simulation Models / Pwheel Input (SiCo)

### Measured Speed Mode

- Functionality already available in Vecto 2.2 added in Vecto 3.0.2
  - Driving cycle not defined by target speed but by actual speed. No driver
    model in the simulation.
  - Gear and engine speed can be specified in the driving cycle. 
    In this case the Vecto gear-shift model is overruled.
  - Function used for “proof of concept” purposes
  - For details see user manual: Calculation Modes / Engineering Mode / Measured Speed


### `.vmod` File Update

- In Vecto 3.0.2 the structure of the modal data output has been
  revised and re-structured. Basicaly for every powertrain component
  the `.vmod` file contains the power at the input shaft and the
  individual power losses for every component. For the engine the
  power, torque and engine speed at the output shaft is given along
  with the internal power and torque used for computing the fuel
  consumption.
- For details see the user manual: Input and Output / Modal Results
  (`.vmod`)

* Minor update in demo data (12t motoring curve)

### VECTO 1.4.RC7
* Bugfix: Error in road gradient resulted in altitude error
* Speed reduction in smaller steps to get closer to full load curve (before speed was sometimes reduced too much and caused problem with gear shifting)
* Updates in demo data

### VECTO 1.4.RC6
* Bugfix in torque converter calculation

* FC extrapolation will not abort calculation. Invalid FC values are marked in output as "ERROR".
* No abortion if transmission output and input torque have different signs (In>0, Out<0). (Caused "Transmission Loss Map invalid" error messages)
* Eco-Roll revised. New rules:
    *  Engages if Pwheel < 0
    *  Disengages if Underspeed is reached.
* Look-Ahead Coasting now uses real coasting also if road gradient > 0 which means the coasting deceleration can be so high that no braking is necessary. In this case the braking phase will be omitted and the total deceleration time can be shorter than expected by the given target coasting deceleration.
* "Minimum (actual) speed" instead of "Min. Target Speed" for Eco-Roll, Overspeed and Look Ahead Coasting
* Major update in Gearbox/Toque Converter:
    *  Torque converter can be defined in multiple gears
    *  Same gear numbers in output as in GBX file, i.e. first gear with TC is not "TC" or "0.5" but simply "1"
    *  "Minimum time between two gear shifts" now also limits torque converter shifts
    *  Unlimited number of gears and new gear list in GUI without fixed gear number
    *  Improved gear shift model for torque converter
    *  Driving Cycle Preprocessing and Gear Shift Model now use approximated efficiency values based in the transmission loss maps. Reduces calculation time significantly with little to no impact on fuel consumption.
* Full load and drag curves (.vfld) can be defined for each gear separately.
* Bugfix: Distance Correction didn't work right with Look Ahead Coasting. Now distance error is acceptable but at the cost of partly interrupted coasting phases. Should be revised in future updates.
* Engine Only Mode: Engine motoring points can be defined explicitly in load cycle with "<DRAG>"
* When speed is under 5km/h and engine in motoring operating then gearbox shifts to Neutral
* Load-dependent rolling resistance coefficient
* Start-Stop activation delay time can be defined in job file
* File signing features added:
    *  After each calculation a signature file (.vsig) is created which includes signatures for all input and result files. The file itself is also signed.
    *  Signature files can be verified or manually created under "Tools" > "Sign or Verify Files"
* Changes in header and new parameters in modal results (.vmod):
    *  engine speed => n
    *  torque => Tq_eng
    *  Pe => Pe_eng
    *  New: Tq_clutch = torque at clutch (before clutch, engine-side)
    *  New: Tq_full = full load torque
    *  New: Tq_drag = drag torque
    *  Removed: Pe_norm, n_norm 
* Changes in summary results (.vsum)
    *  total altitude change instead of average gradient
    *  Auxiliary energy consumption for each auxiliary 
* Removed: Pe_norm, n_norm 
* Same job file list for BATCH and STANDARD (Job file list does not change when switching mode)
