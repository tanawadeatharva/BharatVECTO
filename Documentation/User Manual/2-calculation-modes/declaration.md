##Declaration Mode

In Declaration Mode many input parameters are predefined for the official certification. They are locked in the user interface and will automatically be set by VECTO during calculation. Calculations will be performed for each mission profile (of the corresponding HDV class) with three different loadings each: Empty, full, and reference loading. 

Declaration Mode can be activated in the [Options Tab](#main-form).


###Requirements

-   One or more checked job files in the Job List
-   The job files don't need to include driving cycles. These are automatically assigned.

-   Sum results (.vsum). One file for each invocation of VECTO.
-   Results overview (.pdf). One file for each job.
