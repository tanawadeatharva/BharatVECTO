##Engine: Transient Full Load

The engine implements a PT1 behaviour to model transient torque build up:

$P_{fld\ dyn_{i}} = \frac{1}{T(n_{i})+1} \cdot \left(P_{fld\ stat}(n_{i})+T(n_{i}) \cdot P_{act_{i-1}}\right)$

with:

* n~i~ ... current engine speed
* T(n~i~) ... PT1 time constant at engine speed n~i~ (col. 4 in [.vfld file](#full-load-and-drag-curves-.vfld))
* P~fld\ stat~(n~i~) ... Static full load at engine speed n~i~ (col. 2 in [.vfld file](#full-load-and-drag-curves-.vfld))
* P~act\ i-1~ ... Engine power in previous time step


Vecto 3 uses basically the same PT1 behavior to model transient torque build up. However, due to the dynamic time steps the formula is implemented as follows:

$P_{fld\ dyn_{i}} = P_{fld\ stat}(n_i) \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\frac{t_i^*}{\mathit{PT1}}}\right)$

where t* is computed from the dynamic full-load power in the previous simulation interval:

$t_i^* = t_{i-1}^* + dt$

$t_{i-1}^* = \mathit{PT1} \cdot ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{P_{eng_{i - 1}}}{P_{fld\ stat}(n_i)}}\right)$
