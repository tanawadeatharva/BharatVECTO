##Pneumatic Actuations Map (.apac)
 
This file contains data on number of different kinds of pneumatic actuations on different duty cycles. 

**Important notes**
Note that the cycle file name used should ideally respect this syntax to be correctly associated with the actuation map (.apac), otherwise the number of actuations will be set at 0 by default:

-   "AnyOtherText _X_Bus.vdri", with "X" = "Urban", "Heavy urban", "Suburban", or "Interurban"
-   "AnyOtherText_Coach.vdri"
 
Some flexibility in syntax is allowable (the model looks for ‘Bus’, ‘Coach’, ‘Urban’, etc. in the file name), meaning that the standard default cycles are fully/correctly supported. However, for newly created cycles (i.e. for use in Engineering Mode) it is recommended to follow the above convention to guarantee correct functionality.

###File Format

The file uses the VECTO CSV format, with an example provided below, with the default values based on the methodology agreed with the European Commission and the project Steering Group.
