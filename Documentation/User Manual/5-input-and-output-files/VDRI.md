##Driving Cycles (.vdri)

A Driving Cycle defines the parameters of a simulated route in Vecto. It is either time-based or distance-based and has different fields depending on the driving cycle type.
The basic file format is [Vecto-CSV](#csv) and the file type ending is ".vdri". A Job must have at least one driving cycle (except in Declaration mode, where the driving cycles are predefined).

###Driving Cycle Types
- **Declaration Mode**: [Target speed, distance-based](#declaration-mode-cycles)
- **Verification Test Mode**: [Measured driving cycle, time-based](#verification-test-cycle)
- **Engineering Mode**:
	- [Target speed, distance-based](#engineering-mode-target-speed-distance-based-cycle)
	- [Measured speed, time-based](#engineering-mode-measured-speed-time-based-cycle)
	- [Measured speed with gear, time-based](#engineering-mode-measured-speed-with-gear-time-based-cycle)
	- [Pwheel (SiCo) Mode, time-based](#engineering-mode-pwheel-sico-time-based)
- **Engine Only Mode**: [Engine Only Mode, time-based](#engine-only-mode-engine-only-driving-cycle)


- Distance-based cycles can be defined in any distance resolution, including variable distance steps.
- Time-based cycles can be defined in any time resolution, including variable time steps.

###Declaration Mode Cycles
In Declaration Mode driving cycles are automatically chosen depending on vehicle category and cannot be changed by the user. These predefined cycles are of type target-speed, distance-based.

- Coach: 275km
- Construction: 21km
- Heavy Urban: 30km
- Inter Urban: 123km
- Long Haul: 100km
- Municipal Utility: 10km
- Regional Delivery: 26km
- Sub Urban: 23km

###Verification Test Cycle
This kind of cycle is used for simulating vehicles defined in declaration mode (xml) on a real driving cycle.

###Engineering Mode: Target-Speed, Distance-Based Cycle
This driving cycle defines the target speed over distance. Vecto tries to achieve and maintain this target speed.

Units are optional and are enclosed in [square-brackets] after the header-column. Comments may be written with a preceding hash-sign "#".

**Note:** if the cycle starts with a target speed of 0 km/h and the stop-time for the first entry is 0, VECTO sets the stop-time to 1s automatically.

| *PTO*       | [0/1]  | "0"=disabled or "1"=enabled. If at a vehicle stop (defined by target velocity=0) "1" is specified, the PTO cycle as specified in the *.vptoc–File is simulated. This is described in the [PTO Simulation Model](#pto)  The PTO activation is added to the simulation time in the middle of the stopping time as defined by the cycle parameter "stop". The PTO Cycle can be specified in the [**Vehicle Editor**](#vehicle-editor). When PTO is activated it is recommended to use at least 2 seconds as stop time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

###Engineering Mode: Measured-Speed, Time-Based Cycle
This driving cycle defines the actual measured speed over time. Vecto tries to simulate the vehicle model using this speed as the actual vehicle speed.
Due to differences in the real and simulated shift strategies a small difference in speed can occur, but Vecto immediately tries to catch up after the gear is engaged again.
