## Driving Cycles (.vdri)

A Driving Cycle defines the parameters of a simulated route in VECTO. It is either time-based or distance-based and has different fields depending on the driving cycle type.
The basic file format is [VECTO-CSV](#csv) and the file type ending is ".vdri". A Job must have at least one driving cycle (except in Declaration mode, where the driving cycles are predefined).

### Driving Cycle Types
- **Declaration Mode**: [Target speed, distance-based](#declaration-mode-cycles)
- **Verification Test Mode**: [Measured driving cycle, time-based](#verification-test-cycle)
- **Engineering Mode**:
	- [Target speed, distance-based](#engineering-mode-target-speed-distance-based-cycle)
	- [Measured speed, time-based](#engineering-mode-measured-speed-time-based-cycle)
	- [Measured speed with gear, time-based](#engineering-mode-measured-speed-with-gear-time-based-cycle)
	- [Pwheel (SiCo) Mode, time-based](#engineering-mode-pwheel-sico-time-based)
- **Engine Only Mode**: [Engine Only Mode, time-based](#engine-only-mode-engine-only-driving-cycle)


- Distance-based cycles can be defined in any distance resolution, including variable distance steps.
- Time-based cycles can be defined in any time resolution, including variable time steps.

### Declaration Mode Cycles
In Declaration Mode driving cycles are automatically chosen depending on vehicle category and cannot be changed by the user. These predefined cycles are of type target-speed, distance-based.

- Construction: 100km
- Long Haul: 100km
- Municipal Utility: 11.25km
- Regional Delivery: 100km
- Urban Delivery: 100km

### Verification Test Cycle
This kind of cycle is used for simulating vehicles defined in declaration mode (xml) on a real driving cycle.

Units are optional and are enclosed in [square-brackets] after the header-column. Comments may be written with a preceding hash-sign "#".
**\<n\_fan>** and **\<Pel\_fan>** are mutually exclusive, you can have only one of them in the cycle.

### Engineering Mode: Target-Speed, Distance-Based Cycle
This driving cycle defines the target speed over distance. VECTO tries to achieve and maintain this target speed.

Header: **s, v, stop***\[, Padd]\[, grad]\[, PTO]\[, vair\_res, vair\_beta]*

**Bold columns** are mandatory. *Italic columns* are optional. Only the listed columns are allowed (no other columns!).<br />

### Engineering Mode: Measured-Speed, Time-Based Cycle
This driving cycle defines the actual measured speed over time. Vecto tries to simulate the vehicle model using this speed as the actual vehicle speed.
Due to differences in the real and simulated shift strategies a small difference in speed can occur, but Vecto immediately tries to catch up after the gear is engaged again.
This type of cycle is now supported for BEVs (E2, E3, E4, IEPC) and for parallel HEVs (P1, P2, P2.5, P3, P4, IHPC) also, and it was tested with the following input fields: **t**, **v**, *grad*.

| **t**      | [s]   | The absolute time. Must always be increasing.                                                                     |

| **gear**   | [-]   | The current gear. Must be >= 0 (0 is neutral).                                                                    |
| **n**      | [rpm] | The actual engine speed for conventionals or the electric motor speed for BEVs. Must be >= 0 rpm.                                                                        |
| *Padd*     | [kW]  | Additional auxiliary power demand. This power demand will be directly added to the engine power. Must be >= 0 kW. |

### Engine Only Mode: Engine Only Driving Cycle

This driving cycle directly defines the engine's power or torque at the output shaft over time. VECTO adds the engine's inertia to the given power demand and simulates the engine.
