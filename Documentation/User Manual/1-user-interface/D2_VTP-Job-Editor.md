##VTP-Job Editor

###Description

A VTP-Job is intended to verify the declared data of a vehicle through an on-road test. VTP-Jobs can be either simulated in engineering mode or declaration mode. For a VTP simulation the measured driving cycle along with the VECTO job-file is required. The driving cycle has to contain the vehicle's velocity, rotational speed of the driven wheels, torque of the driven wheels, and fuel consumption in a temporal resolution of 2Hz.
VECTO computes the best matching gear based on the vehicle parameters, the actual vehicle speed and the engine speed.
Next, VECTO re-computes the fuel consumption based for the given driving cycle. For a VTP-test the re-computed fuel consumption has to be within certain limits of the real fuel consumption.

The [VTP job file (.vecto)](#vtp-job-file) includes all informations to run a VECTO calculation. It defines the vehicle and the driving cycle(s) to be used for calculation. In summary it defines:

-   Filepath to the Vehicle File (.xml)](#vehicle-editor which defines all relevant parameters, including all components
-   Driving Cycles


<div class="engineering">
	In engineering mode multiple driving cycles can be specified
</div>
<div class="declaration">
In declaration mode only the first given driving cycle is simulated as the results are further compared with the re-simulated Long-Haul results.

In declaration mode the manufacturer's record file needs to be provided. Furthermore, declaration mode simulations consider correction factors for the net calorific value of the used fuel and the vehicle's mileage. In engineering mode the according input fields are not shown.
</div>

###Relative File Paths

It is recommended to use relative filepaths. This way the Job File and all input files can be moved without having to update the paths. Example: "Vehicles\\Vehicle1.xml" points to the "Vehicles" subdirectory of the Job File's directoy.

VECTO automatically uses relative paths if the input file (e.g. Vehicle File) is in the same directory as the Job File. (*Note:* The Job File must be saved before browsing for input files.)



Cycles

###Chart Area

If a valid Vehicle File is loaded into the Editor the main vehicle parameters like HDV class and axle configuration are shown here. The plot shows the full load curve(s) and sampling points of the fuel consumption map.
