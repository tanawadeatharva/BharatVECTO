##Vehicle Editor

###Description

The [Vehicle File (.vveh)](#vehicle-file) defines the main vehicle/chassis parameters like axles including [RRC](#rolling-resistance-coefficient)s, air resistance and weight.

###Relative File Paths

It is recommended to use relative filepaths. This way the Job File and all input files can be moved without having to update the paths.
Example: "Demo\\RT1.vrlm" points to the "Demo" subdirectory of the Vehicle File's directoy.

VECTO automatically uses relative paths if the input file (e.g. Retarder Losses File) is in the same directory as the Vehicle File. (*Note:* The Vehicle File must be saved before browsing for input files.)

###General vehicle parameters

Vehicle Category
: Needed for [Declaration Mode](#declaration-mode) to identify the HDV Class.

Axle Configuration
: Needed for [Declaration Mode](#declaration-mode) to identify the HDV Class.

Gross Vehicle Mass Rating [t]
: Needed for [Declaration Mode](#declaration-mode) to identify the HDV Class.

HDV Class
: Displays the automatically selected HDV Class depending on the settings above.

###Weight/Loading

Curb Weight Vehicle
: Specifies the vehicle's weight without loading

<div class="engineering">
Curb Weight Extra Trailer/Body
: Specifies additional weight due to superstructures on the vehicle or an additional trailer

Loading
: Speciefies the loading of both, the vehicle and if available the trailer
</div>

**Max. Loading** displays a hint for the maximum possible loading for the selected vehicle depending on curb weight and GVW values (without taking into account the loading capacity of an additional trailer).

***Note:*** *VECTO uses the sum of* ***Curb Weight Vehicle, Curb Weight Extra Trailer/Body*** *and* ***Loading*** *for calculation! The total weight is distributed to all defined axles according to the relative weight share.*

<div class="declaration">
In Declaration Mode only the vehicle itself needs to be specified. Depending on the vehicle category and mission the simulation adds a standard trailer for certain missions.
</div>

###Air Resistance and Corss Wind Correction Options

The product of Drag Coefficient [-] and Cross Sectional Area [m²] (**c~d~ x A**) and **Air Density** [kg/m³] (see [Settings](#settings)) together with the vehicle speed defines the Air Resistance. Vecto uses the combined value **c~d x A** as input. 
**Note that the Air Drag depends on the chosen [**Cross Wind Correction**](#cross-wind-correction).**

<div class="declaration">
If the vehicle has attached a trailer for simulating certain missions the given **c~d~ x A** value is increased by a fixed amount depending on the trailer used for the given vehicle category.
</div>

For cross wind correction four different options are available:
: -  No Correction: The specified CdxA value is used to compute the air drag, no cross-wind correction is applied
-  Speed dependent (User-defined): The specified CdxA value is corrected depending on the vehicle's speed.
-  Speed dependent (Declaration Mode): A uniformly distributed cross-wind is assumed and used for correcting the air-drag depending on the vehicle's speed
-  Vair & Beta Input: Correction mode if the actual wind speed and wind angle relative to the vehicle have been measured.

<div class="declaration">
In delcaration mode the 'Speed dependent (Declaration Mode)' cross-wind correction is used.
</div>

Depending on the chosen mode either a [Speed Dependent Cross Wind Correction Input File (.vcdv)](#speed-dependent-cross-wind-correction-input-file-.vcdv) or a [Vair & Beta Cross Wind Correction Input File (.vcdb)](#speed-dependent-cross-wind-correction-input-file-.vcdv) must be defined. For details see [Cross Wind Correction](#cross-wind-correction).

###Dynamic Tyre Radius

In [Engineering Mode](#engineering-mode) this defines the effective (dynamic) wheel radius (in [mm]) used to calculate engine speed. In [Declaration Mode](#declaration-mode) the radius calculated automatically using tyres of the powered axle.


###Axles/Wheels

For each axle the parameters **Relative axle load, RRC~ISO~** and **F~zISO~** have to be given in order to calculate the total [Rolling Resistance Coefficient](#rolling-resistance-coefficient).

<div class="engineering">
In Engineering mode, the **Wheels Inertia [kgm²]** has to be set per wheel for each axle.
The axles, for both  truck and trailer, have to be given.

Use the ![](pics/plus-circle-icon.png) and ![](pics/minus-circle-icon.png) buttons to add or remove axles form the vehicle. 

</div>

<div class="declaration">
In [Declaration mode](#declaration-mode) only the axles of the truck have to be given (e.g., 2 axles for a 4x2 truck). 
The dynamic tyre radius is derived from the second axle as it is assumed this is the driven axle.
For missions with a trailer predefined wheels and weight-shares are added by Vecto automatically.
</div>

###Retarder Losses

If a separate retarder is used in the vehicle a **Retarder Torque Loss Map** can be defined here to consider idling losses caused by the retarder.

Four options are available:
: -   No retarder
-	Included in Transmission Loss Maps: Use this if the [Transmission Loss Maps](#transmission-loss-map) already include retarder losses.
-   Primary Retarder (before gearbox): The rpm ratio is relative to the engine speed
-   Secondary Retarder (after gearbox): The rpm ratio is relative to the cardan shaft speed

Both, primary and secondary retarders, require an [Retarder Torque Loss Input File (.vrlm)](#retarder-loss-torque-input-file-.vrlm).

The Retarder Ratio defines the ratio between the engine speed/cardan shaft speed and the retarder.

###Angledrive

If an angledrive is used in the vehicle, it can be defined here.
Three options are available:

- None (**default**)
- Separate Angledrive: Use this if the angledrive is measured separately. In this case the ratio must be set and the [Transmission Loss Map](#transmission-loss-map) (or an Efficiency value in Engineering mode) must also be given.
- Included in transmission: Use this if the gearbox already includes the transmission losses for the angledrive in the respective transmission loss maps.


###PTO Transmission

If the vehicle has an PTO consumer, a pto transmission and consumer can be defined here. (Only in [Engineering Mode](#engineering-mode))

Three settings can be set:

- PTO Transmission: Here a transmission type can be chosen (adds constant load at all times).
- PTO Consumer Loss Map (.vptol): Here the [PTO Idle Loss Map](#pto-idle-consumption-map-.vptoi) of the pto consumer can be defined (adds power demand when the pto cycle is not active).
- PTO Cycle (.vptoc): Defines the [PTO Cycle](#pto-cycle-.vptoc) which is used when the pto-cycle is activated (when the PTO-Flag in the driving cycle is set).
