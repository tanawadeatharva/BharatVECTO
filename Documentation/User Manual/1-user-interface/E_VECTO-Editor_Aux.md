###Description


The Auxiliary Dialog is used to configure auxiliaries. In [Declaration Mode](#declaration-mode) the set of auxiliaries and their power demand is pre-defined. For every auxiliary the user has to select the technology from a given list. In [Engineering Mode](#engineering-mode) the set of auxiliaries can be specified by the user. Auxiliary efficieny is defined using an [Auxiliary Input File (.vaux)](#auxiliary-input-file-.vaux). See [Auxiliaries](#auxiliaries) for details on how the power demand for each auxiliary is calculated.
