Summary Results (.vsum)
=======================

The .vsum file includes total / average results for each calculation run in one execution (ie. click of [START Button](#main-form)). The file is located in the directory of the fist run .vecto file.

|  Etransm | [kWh] | Total work of transmission losses
|  Eretarder | [kWh] | Total retarder losses
|  Etorqueconv | [kWh] | Total torque converter losses
|  Mass | [kg] | Vehicle mass (equals **Curb Weight Vehicle** plus **Curb Weight Extra Trailer/Body**, see [Vehicle Editor](#vehicle-editor))

|  a | [m/s²] | Average acceleration
|  a_pos | [m/s²] | Average acceleration in acceleration phases \* 
|  a_neg | [m/s²] | Average deceleration in deceleration phases \*

|  pDec | [%] | Time share of deceleration phases \*
|  pCruise | [%] | Time share of cruise phases \*
|  pStop | [%] | Time share of stop phases \*

\*Driving conditions:

-	Acceleration: a~3s~ &gt; 0.125 \[m/s^2^\]

-	Deceleration: a~3s~ &lt; -0.125 \[m/s^2^\]

-	Cruise: -0.125 ≤ a~3s~ ≤ 0.125 \[m/s^2^\]

-	Stop: v &lt; 0.1 \[m/s\]

	*a~3s~ = 3 seconds-averaged acceleration*


Definition of work (E...):
: sign &gt; 0: positive work applied to the vehicle (e.g. from engine, from kinetic energy)
: sign &lt; 0: losses
: The sum of EposICE, EnegICE, Eair, Eroll, Egrad, Eacc, Eaux, Ebrake, Etransm and Eretarder is zero (besides small rounding error for long driving cycles)
