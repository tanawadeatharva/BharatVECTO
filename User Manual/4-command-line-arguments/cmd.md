##Command Line Arguments

![](pics/cmd.png)

It is possible to control basic functions of VECTO via command line arguments (e.g. to automate calculations and results analysis using scripts).

###General Notes

-   The order in which the arguments are provided is free.
-   If a file path includes space characters (e.g. "C:\\VECTO Test Files\\Demo.vecto") then double quotes have to be used (as in the picture above).
-   If not the complete file path is defined (e.g. "file1.vecto" instead of "c:\\data\\file1.vecto") then VECTO expects the file in the application directory (where VECTO.exe is located).
-   In the instructions below square brackets "\[  \]" indicate optional arguments.



###Standard Mode

        VECTO.exe -run [-close] [file1.vecto file2.vecto ... fileN.vecto]


Runs calculation(s) either with the provided .vecto file(s) or (if no file names are defined) with the files already loaded on start up\*. If -**close** is used then VECTO closes after calculations are done.


###Batch Mode

		VECTO.exe -run -batch [-close] [file1.vecto file2.vecto ... fileN.vecto] [cycle1.vdri cycle2.vdri ... cycleN.vdri]



 Switches to BATCH mode and runs with the provided .vecto and .vdri files. If no files are defined the pre-loaded files\* are used. If -**close** is used then VECTO closes after calculations are done.


###Opening files

		VECTO.exe file1.xxx


If the file has one of the following extensions it is opened with the associated editor dialog: .vecto, .vgbx, .veng, .vveh. Note: if more than one .vecto file is provided they will be loaded in the file list (replacing the pre-loaded list\*) instead.


 *pre-loaded files: When VECTO starts it loads the file lists (.vecto, .vdri) of the last session, see [Application Files](#application-files). These files can be changes manually if VECTO is not running.
