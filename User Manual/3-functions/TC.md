##Torque Converter Model



**!!! The Torque Converter Model is still in development and at the moment only available in Vecto 2.2 !!!**

<div class="vecto2">
The torque converter is defined as (virtual) separate gear. While TC active: Iterative calculation of engine torque and speed based on TC characteristic. Creeping: Engine speed set to idling. Brakes engaged to absorb surplus torque.

###Torque converter characteristics file (.vtcc)

The file is described [here](#torque-converter-characteristics-.vtcc).


###Setup for Conventional AT gearboxes 
Torque converter file is defined for **torque converter only**
![](pics/GBX-TC-Setup-1-1.svg)

-   Define TC gear with ratio of first (mechanical) gear
-   Set transmission losses of first gear (map or constant efficiency)

###Setup for Power-distributed AT gearboxes
Torque converter file is defined for the **whole gearbox**

-   Define TC gear with ratio = 1
-   Set transmission efficiency to 1 (= 100%) because losses are covered  by the .vtcc file.
