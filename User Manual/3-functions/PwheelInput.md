##P~wheel~-Input (SiCo Mode)


For verification tasks it is possible to manually input the power at wheels (P~wheel~) which is normally calculated via longitudinal dynamics. In this case VECTO only calculates the losses between wheels and engine and auxiliary power demand.
This mode is active as soon as P~wheel~, Gear and Engine Speed are defined in the driving cycle.

###Requirements


- Driving Cycle must include P~wheel~ (Pwheel), Gear (Gear) and Engine Speed (n), see [Driving Cycle (.vdri) format](#driving-cycle-.vdri).
- The driving cycle must be time-based.
- Distance Correction must be disabled ([Options tab in Main Form](#options-tab)).

**Example driving cycle with P~wheel~ input.**
