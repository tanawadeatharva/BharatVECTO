##Auxiliary Input File (.vaux)
This file is used to configure a single auxiliary. Multiple .vaux files can be defined in the [Job File](#job-editor) via the [Auxiliary Dialog](#auxiliary-dialog). The file uses the [VECTO CSV format](#csv) with three additional parameters on top of the efficiency map.

See [Auxiliaries](#auxiliaries) for details on how the power demand for each auxiliary is calculated.

- Filetype: .vaux
- Multiple Header must exist in the following sequence:
    - **[TransRatio \[-\]](#auxiliaries)**: Speed ratio between auxiliary and engine. 1 Value.
    - **[EffToEng \[-\]](#auxiliaries)**: Efficiency of auxiliary (belt/gear) drive. 1 Value.
    - **[EffToSply \[-\]](#auxiliaries)**: Consumer efficiency. 1 Value.
    - **Auxiliary speed [rpm], Mechanical power [kW],Supply power [kW]**

- Requires at least 3 data entries for the last header.

**Example:**

    Transmission ration to engine rpm [-]
    4.078
    Efficiency to engine [-]
    0.96
    Efficiency auxiliary to supply [-]
