##Fuel Consumption Map (.vmap)
The FC map is used to interpolate the base fuel consumption before corrections are applied. For details see [Fuel Consumption Calculation](#fuel-consumption-calculation).

###File Format
The file uses the [VECTO CSV format](#csv-format).

Format:
: -   Three columns
-   One header line
-   At least four lines with numeric values (below file header)
-   The map must cover the full engine range between full load and motoring curve. **Extrapolation is not possible!**

***Columns:***
