##CSV
Many data files in Vecto use CSV (Comma Separated Values) as common file format. They consist of a header which defines the columns and data entries which are separated by a comma (",").

<div class="vecto3">
In Vecto 3 the order of the columns is arbitrary if the column header matches the header definitions described in this user manual. If the column header does not match, a warning is written to the log file and the columns are parsed in the sequence as described in this manual as a fall-back.
</div>

|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header:**             | Vecto CSV needs exactly one header line with the definition of the columns at the beginning of the file. Columns can be surrounded with "<" and ">" to mark them as identifiers (which makes them position independent) (In Vecto 3.x every column is seen as identifier, regardless of "<>"). Columns may be succeded with unit information (enclosed in "[" and "]") for documentation purposes. |
| **Column Separator:**   | **,** (Comma. Separates the columns of a data line.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Decimal-Mark:**       | **.** (Dot. Splits numbers into integer part and decimal part.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Thousand-Separator:** | Vecto CSV does not allow a thousand-separator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Comments:**           | **#** (Number sign. Declares text coming afterwards in the current line as comment.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Whitespace:**         | Whitespaces between columns will be stripped away. Therefore it is possible to align the columns for better readability, if desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
