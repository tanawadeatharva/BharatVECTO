##Driving Cycle (.vdri)


The Driving Cycle defines vehicle speed, road gradient and other parameters either time- or distance-based. It's open format requires Idenfiers to define the content of each column.

###Important Notes


- For distance-based cycles there is a minimum distance-step of 1[m] required. The calculation will abort if larger steps are used.
- Time-based cycles can be defined in any given time resolution, including variable time steps. If the time identifier "\<t\>" is not used the data will be interpreted in 1[s] resolution (1Hz).

###Supported Identifiers

| Identifier | Quantity | Unit   | Description                                     
| ---------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------
| **\<s\>** 		 | Distance	| [m]    | Travelled distance used for distance-based cycles. If \<t\> is also defined this column will be ignored.
| **\<t\>**        | Time     | [s]    | Used for time-based cycles. If neither this nor the distance \<s\> is defined the data will be interpreted as 1Hz.
| **\<v\>** | Vehicle Speed   | [km/h] | Required except for [Engine Only Mode](#engine-only-mode) and [P~wheel~-Input](#pwheel-input-sico-mode) calculations.
| **\<grad\>** | Road Gradient | \[%\] | Optional.
| **\<stop\>** | Stopping Time | \[s\] | Required for distance-based cycles. Not used in time based cycles. \<stop\> defines the time the vehicle spends in stop phases.
| **\<Aux_xxx\>** | Auxiliary Supply Power | \[kW\] | Supply Power input for each auxiliary defined in the [.vecto file](#job-editor) where xxx matches the ID of the corresponding [Auxiliary](#auxiliary-dialog). ID's are not case sensitive and must not contain space or special characters.
| **\<n\>** | Engine Speed | \[rpm\] | If \<n\> is defined VECTO uses that instead of the calculated engine speed value.
| **\<gear\>** | Gear	| \[-\] | Gear input. Overwrites the gear shift model.
| **\<Padd\>** | Additional Aux Power Demand | \[kW\]	| This power input will be directly added to the engine power in addition to possible other auxiliaries. Also used in [Engine Only Mode](#engine-only-mode).
| **\<vair_res\>** | Air speed relative to vehicle | \[km/h\] | Only required if [**Cross Wind Correction**](#cross-wind-correction) is set to **Vair & Beta Input**.
| **\<vair_beta\>** | Wind Yaw Angle | \[°\] | Only required if [**Cross Wind Correction**](#cross-wind-correction) is set to **Vair & Beta Input**.
| **\<Pe\>** | Engine power | \[kW\] | Effective engine power at clutch. Only required in [Engine Only Mode](#engine-only-mode). Alternatively torque <Me> can be defined. Use **\<DRAG>** to define motoring operation.
| **\<Me\>** | Engine torque | \[Nm\] | Effective engine torque at clutch. Only required in [Engine Only Mode](#engine-only-mode). Alternatively power <Pe> can be defined. Use **\<DRAG\>** to define motoring operation.
| **\<Pwheel\>** | Power at wheels | \[kW\] | Overwrites power calculation. Requires Gear and Engine Speed input. Cycle must be time based.

###Examples

The demo data provided with VECTO contains several .vdri files that may be used as template.
